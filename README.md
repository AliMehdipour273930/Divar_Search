A multimodal semantical search engine using cutting edge multimodal encoders 
The next generation of search engines is coming.
I am happy to share that with you. I developed a Multi-modal multilingual semantic search engine and the results are astonishing. Now, you can search posts, based on texts and images. You can describe the specification of your desired item, the engine will search for that specification on related visual and textual data and answer based on both of them. 
You can describe the specifications of your desired item, and this search engine not only look for it in the textual data, but also it will look for it in the related pictures of that post! 
Besides that, this is multilingual and you can search with 79 languages.
For example: 
If you search Sponge Bob : it will retrieve a post such that one of its images contains a tiny picture of Sponge Bob inside an LCD screen 😁 

Another example: If you search European, it will retrieve all the documents that their image has something related to Europe. It may be a picture of Paris in a shirt or a sentence of Made in Italy or simply it has a flag of a European country. 

It has nothing to do with text matching. It is about semantics

You can search like this: 
I want a blue talkative bird with yellow feathers ==> It will retrieve exactly a parrot with these features as the top most similar results to your query. 

Queries type: image - text - text and image 

Retrieval time: maximum 400 ms
Pictures Count: 170000
Posts Count: 50000

I will try to run this project on a website so that everyone can access it and test it. Will you try it?
